# Patient Appointment Data Analysis

Data Analysis of missed appointments by patients

In healthcare systems, it is common for patients to book their medical appoinment and after receiving all the instructions missing their scheduled appointment which incurs cost on the healthcare system.

Analayzing No-Show data for medical appointments can help healthcare systems to decide interventions in future such as reminder calls for the appointments, reschedule an appointment and in turn reduce the financial loss.

The project has exploratory data analysis performed on medical appointments for healthcare systems in a city of Brazil based on data in year 2016.

The project identifies varies features of the data including dependent, independent variables and examines data observations.

Based on certain features, the project identifies probability calculation for not showing up for an appointment.

The project analyzes data in following tasks:

1. Percentage of the appointment data with No Show for the appointment
2. Features based probability calculation for not showing up for an appointment
3. Gender Based No-Show appointment analysis
4. Show and No-Show appointment distribution over a week
5. Medical Condition based on Pattern 

    5.1 Analysis of patient data with different medical conditions based on appointment day of week

    5.2 Analysis of patient data with different medical conditions showing different Show-Up rate over day of week
    
    5.3 Show up rate based on gender
    
    5.4 Show up rate based on medical conditions and age
6. Correlation between medical conditions
7. Analysis of how sending SMS affects show or No-Show ratio

Conclusions from the project :

I have cleaned the data by renaming columns, removing unnecessary data, adding features based on current data and analyzed the data.
I have performed analysis on most of the independent variables and observed some relation between them and dependent variable Appointment_Status.
Many potential correlation remain uncovered as this was exploratory analysis.
However, I could identify potential areas/features which could have been improved or can be used in future for the specific dataset.
Improving and taking measures to make changes in those areas could reduce No-Show Appointments.
